# Week 2: The Surrounding Area - <span style="font-size:large;">Map the land around the dungeon and town</span>
__Note__:  As this is an urban setting, I'll have to change this up a little.  Rather than mapping out the area
 surrounding a town and a dungeon entrance, I'll map out a neighborhood and points of interest.
  
__Note:__ I attempted the extra credit step of "pimp your map using coffee stains and burning the edges a little".  I
 soaked my monitor in coffee for an hour then charred the edges.  I do not recommend this step.
 
## Setting
Our adventure will take place in modern New Orleans, focusing initially on [The Garden District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_District,_New_Orleans#History)
 and the [Irish Channel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Channel,_New_Orleans#History).
