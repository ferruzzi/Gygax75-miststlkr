# Week 2: The Surrounding Area - <span style="font-size:large;">Map the land around the dungeon and town</span>
__Note__:  As this is an urban setting, I'll have to change this up a little.  Rather than mapping out the area
 surrounding a town and a dungeon entrance, I'll map out a neighborhood and points of interest.
  
__Note:__ I attempted the extra credit step of "pimp your map using coffee stains and burning the edges a little".  I
 soaked my monitor in coffee for an hour then charred the edges.  I do not recommend this step.
 
## Setting
Our adventure will take place in modern New Orleans, focusing initially on
 [The Garden District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_District,_New_Orleans#History)
 and the [Irish Channel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Channel,_New_Orleans#History).  Naturally some liberties
 can and will be taken with regards to landmarks and history.

### Places of Interest
#### Crescent City Used Books 
**Location**: (fictional) Magazine St and Fourth St

**Public Interest**: A used book store run by a kindly old widower who will talk your ear off. 

**Special Interest**: Run by a half-fey who keeps an impressive collection of Special Interest books in the back
 room for those who know to ask.
  
#### Riverwalk Market <span style="font-size:medium;">(Actually based more off Seattle's Pike Place Market)</span>
**Location**: Poydras St and Canal St (technically off the map, see "Special Interest" below)

**Public Interest**: Three floors of shopping on the old wharf.  The public ground/entrance floor contains mainly a
 collection of shops selling various crafts aimed at the many tourists.  The upper floor is made up predominantly of 
 food vendors and restaurants taking advantage of the elevation to show views of the Mississippi River.  One floor 
 down from the entrance is a bit more eccentric, filled with niche specialty shops who can only survive because of 
 the lower rent of the underground location on the waterfront.  

**Special Interest**: All three floors are connected by a confusing series of ramps rather than stairs or elevators.
 This has made it possible to obscure the fact that if you know where to look, one ramp will lead  down further into
 The Submarket.  Shops in The Submarket cater to the Others and get increasing more esoteric.  It consists of several
 more floors of shops and dining, well below the point where you should be in the river.  There is a direct entrance to 
 this section through a basement door in the old ferry terminal at the end of Jackson Street.
    
#### Suave Swanky Other Hangout - they can't all live in the basement
**Location**: W Hotel comes to mind?  

**Public Interest**:

**Special Interest**:

#### Lafayette Cemetery ([images](https://tinyurl.com/y6wtx38z))
**Location**: Washington Ave at Prytania St

**Public Interest**: Founded in 1833 and still in use today, this is said to be a major inspiration to Anne Rice when
 writing the Interview books, and is the filming location for many scenes of the movie.  It is a popular destination
 for fans of the work as well as history enthusiasts.  

**Special Interest**: Something something underground something ancient cemetery something something. 

#### Commander's Palace ([images](https://tinyurl.com/y8rrwyyx))
**Location**: Washington Ave at Coliseum St

**Public Interest**: One of the oldest continuously-running restaurants in North America, it must have some
 interesting connections to old-world old-money.  

**Special Interest**:  Possibly a stronghold of The Organization, or maybe they are based out of one of the mansions
 further Uptown near the Audubon?  I think I want to base some supernatural mafia out of the place and leave the
 Organization to their haughty mansions and manors uptown

#### Christ Church Cathedral ([images](https://tinyurl.com/y7kp2xes))
**Location**: St Charles Ave at Sixth St

**Public Interest**: The Christ Church Cathedral is the first non-Roman Catholic Church in the state of Louisiana. The
 church, originally erected in 1816 at Canal and Bourbon Streets, was redesigned three times to compensate its growing 
 membership.

**Special Interest**:  

#### Anne Rice Mansion ([images](https://tinyurl.com/ycxahccy))
**Location**: Napolean Ave at Prytania

**Public Interest**: The home that Anne Rice lived in while writing _Interview With The Vampire_ and other novels.

**Special Interest**: You didn't really believe those novels were all fiction, did you?

#### Trolley Stop Cafe
**Location**: St Charles Ave at St Andrew St

**Public Interest**: 24-hour breakfast-all-day diner with amazing biscuits and gravy.  

**Special Interest**: Popular local hangout for the younger (that can be a very relative term) crowd, 24-hour service
 makes it suitable for meeting Others who can pass as human. 

#### Breaux Mart
**Location**:  Camp St at Pleasant St

**Public Interest**: Independently-owned grocery with good selection and some hard-to-find foods

**Special Interest**: Use the underground entrance through the adjacent Montiero Park for an even more exciting
 selection  

#### Langenstein's Antiques
**Location**: (fictional) Magazine St at General Pershing St

**Public Interest**: An antique shop absolutely packed with all sorts of random ~~junk~~ treasures of every
 description.  The shop has been run by the same family since the 1800's and some locals joke that most of the
  inventory was there when they opened.  It's a popular stop for tourists and local artists.  The shopkeep loves a
  challenge and will gladly take a commission to hunt down a particular vintage item if you have something special in
  mind.
       
**Special Interest**: The shopkeeper's connections go much deeper than normal folks would suspect.  This (man?) can
 find you a ceremonial dagger from ancient Athens or a vial of purple nightshade extract if your pockets are deep
 enough and you know how to ask.
