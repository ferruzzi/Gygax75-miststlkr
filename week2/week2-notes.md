# Week 2: The Surrounding Area - <span style="font-size:large;">Map the land around the dungeon and town</span>
__Note__:  As this is an urban setting, I'll have to change this up a little.  Rather than mapping out the area
 surrounding a town and a dungeon entrance, I'll map out a neighborhood and points of interest.
  
__Note:__ I attempted the extra credit step of "pimp your map using coffee stains and burning the edges a little".  I
 soaked my monitor in coffee for an hour then charred the edges.  I do not recommend this step.
 
## Setting
Our adventure will take place in modern New Orleans, focusing initially on [The Garden District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_District,_New_Orleans#History)
 and the [Irish Channel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Channel,_New_Orleans#History).

### Places of Interest
#### Crescent City Used Books
Location: Magazine and Fourth
Interest: Run by a half-fey who keeps an impressive collection of arcane books in the back room for those who know to
 ask. 
#### Riverwalk Market
Location: Public Entrance: Poyrdas St and Canal St (technically off the map, see description)
Interest: Three floors of shopping on the old wharf.  The public ground/entrance floor contains mainly a collection of
 shops selling various crafts aimed at the many tourists.  The upper floor is made up predominantly of food vendors and restaurants taking
 advantage of the elevation to show views of the Mississippi River.  One floor down from the entrance is a bit more
 eccentric, filled with niche specialty shops who can only survive because of the lower rent of the underground
 location on the waterfront.  All three floors are connected by a confusing series of ramps rather than stairs or
 elevators.   This has made it possible to obscure the fact that if you know where to look, one ramp will lead
 down further into The Submarket.  Shops in The Submarket cater to the Others and get increasing more esoteric.  It
 consists of several more floors of shops and dining, well below the point where you should be in the river.  There
 is a direct entrance to this section through a basement door in the old ferry terminal at the end of Jackson Street.
