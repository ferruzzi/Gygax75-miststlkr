# Week 2: The Surrounding Area - <span style="font-size:large;">Map the land around the dungeon and town</span>
__Note__:  As this is an urban setting, I'll have to change this up a little.  Rather than mapping out the area
 surrounding a town and a dungeon entrance, I'll map out a neighborhood and points of interest.
  
__Note:__ I attempted the extra credit step of "pimp your map using coffee stains and burning the edges a little".  I
 soaked my monitor in coffee for an hour then charred the edges.  I do not recommend this step.
 
## Setting
Our adventure will take place in modern New Orleans, focusing initially on [The Garden District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_District,_New_Orleans#History)
 and the [Irish Channel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Channel,_New_Orleans#History).

### Places of Interest
#### Crescent City Used Books 
**Location**: (fictional) Magazine St and Fourth St

**Public Interest**: A used book store run by a kindly old widower who will talk your ear off. 

**Special Interest**: Run by a half-fey who keeps an impressive collection of Special Interest books in the back
 room for those who know to ask.
  
#### Riverwalk Market <span style="font-size:medium;">(Actually based more off Seattle's Pike Place Market)</span>
**Location**: Poydras St and Canal St (technically off the map, see description)

**Public Interest**: Three floors of shopping on the old wharf.  The public ground/entrance floor contains mainly a
 collection of shops selling various crafts aimed at the many tourists.  The upper floor is made up predominantly of 
 food vendors and restaurants taking advantage of the elevation to show views of the Mississippi River.  One floor 
 down from the entrance is a bit more eccentric, filled with niche specialty shops who can only survive because of 
 the lower rent of the underground location on the waterfront.  

**Special Interest**: All three floors are connected by a confusing series of ramps rather than stairs or elevators.  This 
 has made it possible to obscure the fact that if you know where to look, one ramp will lead  down further into The 
 Submarket.  Shops in The Submarket cater to the Others and get increasing more esoteric.  It consists of several more 
 floors of shops and dining, well below the point where you should be in the river.  There is a direct entrance to this 
 section through a basement door in the old ferry terminal at the end of Jackson Street.
    
#### Suave Swanky Other Hangout - they can't all live in the basement
**Location**: W Hotel comes to mind?  

**Public Interest**:

**Special Interest**:

#### Lafayette Cemetery ([images](https://tinyurl.com/y6wtx38z))
**Location**: Washington Ave at Prytania St

**Public Interest**:

**Special Interest**:

#### Commander's Palace ([images](https://tinyurl.com/y8rrwyyx))
**Location**:

**Public Interest**: One of the oldest continuously-running restaurants in North America, it must have some interesting
 connections to old-world old-money.  Possibly a stronghold of The Organization, or maybe they are based out of one
 of the mansions further uptown near the Audubahn?

**Special Interest**:   

#### Christ Church Cathedral ([images](https://tinyurl.com/y7kp2xes))
**Location**: St Charles Ave at Sixth St

**Public Interest**: The Christ Church Cathedral is the first non-Roman Catholic Church in the state of Louisiana. The
 church, originally erected in 1816 at Canal and Bourbon Streets, was redesigned three times to compensate its growing 
 membership. Architect Lawrence B. Valk designed the current church in 1886.
