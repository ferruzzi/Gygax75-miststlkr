# Concepts
 1. Modern age urban fantasy set in the real world
 2. All players are human or fey half-breeds who can pass as human
    - Spellcasters are half-breeds and non-casters are human or less-than-half breeds
 3. Magic exists but is very rare; average person does not believe in it
 4. Casters know one skill/spell/power and that skill evolves over time
    - At creation you choose one spell theme (fire, travel, healing, luck, etc) and X attributes (ranged, sustained, aoe, 
      stealth etc) and gain attributes each level; attributes stack (range plus range = longer range)
 5. Casters are actively hunted by a shadowy organization
    - _"There are two types of casters: those who hide their powers and those strong enough to defend themselves"_ - 
    Some Smart Guy With A Thematically Appropriate  Name
 6. Magic has a cost; every spell cast has to be balanced against the price paid
 

# Inspirations
 - The Dresden Files
   - Modern setting where all the fairy tales are real
 - The Magicians
   - The Library in late seasons
 - The Black Company
   - Sorcerers are powerful one-trick ponies who need other skills to remain useful
 - The Matrix
   - Some thematic elements as far as a band of underdog rebels on the lam fighting The Man 

# Base System
  Character generation will be based on Shadowrun 3rd Edition without the option for cyber-/bio-tech or metahumans. 
  The magic system will be generalized in order to make it more customizable
  
#### Reasons
 - The magic restrictions basically kill any system designed for fantasy
 - SR includes Drain as a cost of casting
 - A skill-point based build system allows custom characters without locking players into the very few remaining classes
 - I really like the SR rules for Qualities and Flaws  
  
# Questions
 - Why on earth would anyone play this?  Sample character concepts:
   - A coven of hedge witches banding together to fight for scraps from the library
   - A human who lost a sorcerous loved one to the library and wants revenge
   -  
 - What is the goal/point/hook; what is an "adventure" in a setting like this?
 - What signifies XP/Karma in a setting like this?
   - It would almost certainly have to be a milestone-based system
   
# Considerations  
  - Look into the power creation system from Champions for spell creation
  - Think about how to price spell augmentations; perhaps equal to a stat point increase
