# Concepts
 1. Gritty modern age urban fantasy set in the real world
 2. All players are human or fey half-breeds who can pass as human; the choice has no effect on stats
    - Spellcasters are half-breeds and non-casters are human or less-than-half breeds
 3. Magic exists but is very rare; average person does not believe in it
 4. Casters know one skill/spell/power and that skill evolves over time
    - At creation you choose one spell theme (fire, travel, healing, luck, etc) and X attributes (ranged, sustained, AoE, 
      stealth etc) and gain attributes each level; attributes stack (range plus range = longer range)
 5. Casters are actively hunted by a shadowy organization
    - _"There are two types of casters: those who hide their powers and those strong enough to defend themselves"_ - 
    Some Smart Guy With A Thematically Appropriate  Name
 6. Magic has a cost; every spell cast has to be balanced against the price paid, spells can be overcharged if you are willing to make the sacrifice
 
# Inspirations
 - The Dresden Files
   - Modern setting where all the fairy tales are real
 - The Magicians
   - The Library in late seasons
 - The Black Company
   - Sorcerers are powerful mostly-one-trick ponies who need other skills to remain useful
 - The Matrix
   - Some thematic elements as far as a band of underdog rebels on the lam fighting The Man 

# Base System
  Character generation will be based on Shadowrun 3rd Edition without the option for cyber-/bio-tech or metahumans. 
  The magic system will be generalized in order to make it more customizable, possibly based off the power design system in Champions
  
#### Advantages for picking SR3
 - The low magic restrictions basically kill any system designed for fantasy
 - SR includes Drain as a cost of casting which is a key point of this system
 - A skill-point based build system allows custom characters without locking players into the very few remaining classes
 - I really like the SR Qualities and Flaws character generation rules
 - In general, it's a simple system.  Attribute + Skill = number of d6 to roll.  Every 5 or 6 is a success, every 1 is a fail.  Roll more successes than fails to pass, or if it's contested, roll more successes than the opponent.
#### Disdvantages for picking SR3
  - Not a popular system
  - Buckets of d6s
  - Removing basically everything "cyber" from a cyberpunk game may be more difficult than just pulling it out of the setting, it may result in an inherently unbalanced game
 
# Spell concept examples
This may be an entire future project, but as an example:
 - Firebringer - A (non-explosive) ball of flame about the size of a baseball that can be thrown
   - Base: Fire
     - Starting Attributes: Duration, Movable
     - Level 2 Upgrade: Damage Upgrade
     - Level 3 Upgrade: Movable (add speed)
     - Level 4 Upgrade: Movable (add range)
     - Level 5 Upgrade: AoE (explodes on command)  
     - Level 6 Upgrade: AoE (larger radius)
  
# Questions
 - Why on earth would anyone play this?  Sample character concepts:
   - A coven of hedge witches banding together to fight for scraps from the library
   - A human who lost a sorcerous loved one to the library and wants revenge
   -  
 - What is the goal/point/hook; what is an "adventure" in a setting like this?
 - What signifies XP/Karma in a setting like this?
   - It would almost certainly have to be a milestone-based system
   
# Considerations  
  - Look into the power creation system from Champions for spell creation
  - Think about how to price spell augmentations; perhaps equal to a stat point increase
