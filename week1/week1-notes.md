# Week 1: Concepts - <span style="font-size:large;">Articulate the big ideas and gather sources</span>
 1. Gritty modern age urban fantasy set in the real world
 2. All players are human or fey half-breeds who can pass as human
    - The choice has no effect on stats
    - Spell casters are half-breeds and non-casters are human or distant fey descendants
 3. Magic exists but is very rare; average person does not believe in it
 4. Casters know one skill/spell/power and that skill evolves over time
    - At creation you choose one spell theme (fire, travel, healing, luck, etc) and X attributes (ranged, sustained, AoE, 
      stealth etc) and gain attributes each level; attributes stack (range plus range = longer range)
 5. Casters are actively hunted by a shadowy organization
    - _"There are two types of casters: those who hide their powers and those strong enough to defend themselves"_ - 
    Some Smart Guy With A Thematically Appropriate  Name
 6. Magic has a cost; every spell cast has to be balanced against the price paid, spells can be overcharged if you are willing to make the sacrifice
 
# Inspirations
 - The Dresden Files
   - Modern setting where all the fairy tales are real
 - The Magicians
   - The Library in late seasons
 - The Black Company
   - Sorcerers are powerful mostly-one-trick ponies who need other skills to remain useful
 - The Matrix
   - Some thematic elements as far as a band of underdog rebels on the lam fighting The Man
 - Hellboy
   - The Troll Market where there is a thriving market of/for/by non-humans right under our noses

# Questions
 - Why on earth would anyone play this?  Sample character concepts:
   - A coven of hedge witches banding together to fight for scraps from The Organization
   - A human who lost a sorcerous loved one to The Organization and wants revenge
   - A local merchant who was helped by a sorcerer and has joined the cause, using their contacts and negotiation skills
   - A local hunter entered the wrong glade on the wrong moonlit night and got drawn into this world
   - A college kid tinkering with "ancient rituals" they found online realizes one actually worked
 - What is the goal/point/hook; what is an "adventure" in a setting like this?
   - There would need to be some kind of general threat that the players can handle; some wee beasties that normal folks can't see/handle themselves.  All mythical creatures are real and the players could be called on to 
     deal with any of those.  Carrying on the fey concept, brownies/sprites/etc are real and cause day to day issues of 
     various severity.  These plus standard human issues like gangs can be your general threat and lower level 
     challenges before being noticed by and dealing with an global conspiracy.
   - Lower levels could focus on carving out a local safe haven helping a neighborhood and winning friends/allies. 
     Human threats in the form of gangs and sundry hooligans threaten the neighborhood, plus the occasional 
     malevolent/spiteful pixie that needs to be defeated/relocated/appeased.  Through the course of these challenges, 
     the players carve out a neighborhood of supporters and allies.
   - It should be emphasized that murderhobos will draw the attention of The Organization far more quickly and outright
     murder is to be used as a last resort.  Appease the hungry brownie hunting stray cats, convince the gremlin 
     turning the produce at Joe's Market sour to move to a wild blueberry patch in the woods instead, set a trap for 
     the guy breaking into shops and stealing the tills at night so he gets caught by the cops, etc.  The extermination
     of all wild fey in an area or a body found in an alley _will_ be noticed and investigated by a force much stronger
     than the players, be it The Organization or the mortal law enforcement.
 - What signifies XP/Karma in a setting like this?
   - It would almost certainly have to be a milestone-based system


# Base System
  Currently looking into various superhero systems to find one I like as the envisioned magic system is more akin to a
   superhero than to a magic caster in most settings.
   
#### System Considerations/Goals
 - The low magic restrictions basically kill any system designed for fantasy worlds
 - Shadowrun includes Drain (mental strain/damage) as a cost of casting which is a key point of this system
 - A skill-point based build system allows custom characters without locking players into the very few remaining classes
 - I really like the SR Qualities and Flaws character generation rules
 - Powers should be able to evolve as play progresses
 
### Systems that folks have suggested
 - **HERO/Champions**
   - Very open power system based on points to build a power, this sounds pretty close to what I have in mind
   - There is a street-level companion book which might be perfect, needs research
   - Powers cost Endurance to use 
 - **Mutants and Masterminds**
   - Super crunchy, lots of math and mechanics
 - **City of Mist**
   - A modern world noir superpower game.  This actually sounds pretty ideal thematically
   - Looking at the character generation rules, they are a bit too loose for my taste
 
# Spell concept examples
This may be an entire future project, but as an example:
 - Firebringer - A (non-explosive) ball of flame about the size of a baseball that can be thrown
   - Base: Fire
     - Starting Attributes: Duration, Movable
     - Level 2 Upgrade: Damage Upgrade
     - Level 3 Upgrade: Movable (add speed)
     - Level 4 Upgrade: Movable (add range)
     - Level 5 Upgrade: AoE (explodes on command)  
     - Level 6 Upgrade: AoE (larger radius)
