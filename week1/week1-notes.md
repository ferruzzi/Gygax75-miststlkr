# Concepts
 1. Gritty modern age urban fantasy set in the real world
 2. All players are human or fey half-breeds who can pass as human; the choice has no effect on stats
    - Spellcasters are half-breeds and non-casters are human or less-than-half breeds
 3. Magic exists but is very rare; average person does not believe in it
 4. Casters know one skill/spell/power and that skill evolves over time
    - At creation you choose one spell theme (fire, travel, healing, luck, etc) and X attributes (ranged, sustained, AoE, 
      stealth etc) and gain attributes each level; attributes stack (range plus range = longer range)
 5. Casters are actively hunted by a shadowy organization
    - _"There are two types of casters: those who hide their powers and those strong enough to defend themselves"_ - 
    Some Smart Guy With A Thematically Appropriate  Name
 6. Magic has a cost; every spell cast has to be balanced against the price paid, spells can be overcharged if you are willing to make the sacrifice
 
# Inspirations
 - The Dresden Files
   - Modern setting where all the fairy tales are real
 - The Magicians
   - The Library in late seasons
 - The Black Company
   - Sorcerers are powerful mostly-one-trick ponies who need other skills to remain useful
 - The Matrix
   - Some thematic elements as far as a band of underdog rebels on the lam fighting The Man 

# Base System
  Currently looking into various superhero systems to find one I like as the envisioned magic system is more akin to a
   superhero than to a magic caster in most settings.
   
#### System Considerations/Goals
 - The low magic restrictions basically kill any system designed for fantasy worlds
 - Shadowrun includes Drain (mental strain/damage) as a cost of casting which is a key point of this system
 - A skill-point based build system allows custom characters without locking players into the very few remaining classes
 - I really like the SR Qualities and Flaws character generation rules
 - Powers should be able to evolve as play progresses
 
### Systems that folks have suggested
 - **HERO/Champions**
   - Very open power system based on points to build a power, this sounds pretty close to what I have in mind
   - There is a street-level companion book which might be perfect, needs research
   - Powers cost Endurance to use 
 - **Mutants and Masterminds**
   - Super crunchy, lots of math and mechanics
 - **City of Mist**
   - A modern world noir superpower game.  This actually sounds pretty ideal thematically
   - Looking at the character generation rules, they are a bit too loose for my taste
 
# Spell concept examples
This may be an entire future project, but as an example:
 - Firebringer - A (non-explosive) ball of flame about the size of a baseball that can be thrown
   - Base: Fire
     - Starting Attributes: Duration, Movable
     - Level 2 Upgrade: Damage Upgrade
     - Level 3 Upgrade: Movable (add speed)
     - Level 4 Upgrade: Movable (add range)
     - Level 5 Upgrade: AoE (explodes on command)  
     - Level 6 Upgrade: AoE (larger radius)
  
# Questions
 - Why on earth would anyone play this?  Sample character concepts:
   - A coven of hedge witches banding together to fight for scraps from the library
   - A human who lost a sorcerous loved one to the library and wants revenge
   -  
 - What is the goal/point/hook; what is an "adventure" in a setting like this?
 - What signifies XP/Karma in a setting like this?
   - It would almost certainly have to be a milestone-based system
   
# Considerations  
  - Look into the power creation system from Champions for spell creation
  - Think about how to price spell augmentations; perhaps equal to a stat point increase
