# Week 3: The Dungeon - <span style="font-size: large;">Draw and stock three levels of your dungeon</span>

## The Grinnan House 
Detailed historical information and photos available [here](http://www.historic-structures.com/la/new_orleans/grinnan_house.php) and [here](https://www.loc.gov/resource/hhh.la0065.sheet).

### Adventure Concept:
The plot hook is that one of the _neuveau riche_ has been acting a fool and is getting scrutinized.  Rumours have been circulating that the family's sudden turn of fortune is due to enslaving/exploiting an Other (research beasties who are 
supposed to grant/bring luck).  Players will investigate either out of a desire to save the poor critter or as an assignment if working through a larger organization.  Multiple options are available for how and when to conduct the 
investigation including an upcoming gala, sneaking in at night, or the old "steal some exterminator uniforms" trick.
A completed investigation will uncover a (beastie) enslaved in the sub-basement which should in turn beg the question
that, in a world which does not generally believe in Others, where/how did this family get one and how have they 
managed to keep it trapped?  Further adventures may uncover a larger conspiracy, a smuggling ring, perhaps it's a 
pyramid scheme "I got rich almost overnight and for only $xxxx I can show you my secrets!"

Built in 1850, this house has famously few modifications from the original design.
