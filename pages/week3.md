# Week 3: The Dungeon - <span style="font-size: large;">Draw and stock three levels of your dungeon</span>
Challenge: d6+6 rooms per level, 11 monsters total, d6 features (traps, etc) total, 3 wondrous items total

### Adventure Concept:
The plot hook is that one of the _neuveau riche_ has been acting like a fool and is getting scrutinized. Rumours have
been circulating that the family's sudden turn of fortune is due to enslaving/exploiting an Other (research beasties who
are supposed to grant/bring luck or money). Players will investigate either out of a desire to save the poor
critter or as an assignment if working through a larger organization.  Multiple options are available for how and
when to conduct the investigation including an upcoming gala, sneaking in at night, or the old "steal some
exterminator uniforms" trick. A completed investigation will uncover a (beastie) enslaved in the sub-basement which
should in turn beg the question that, in a world which does not generally believe in Others, where/how did this
family get one and how have they managed to keep it trapped?  Further adventures may uncover a larger conspiracy, a
smuggling ring, perhaps it's a pyramid scheme "I got rich almost overnight and for only $xxxx I can show you my
secrets!"

## The Grinnan House 
Built in 1850, this house has famously few modifications from the original design.
